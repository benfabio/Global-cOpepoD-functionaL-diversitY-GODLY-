# Global-cOpepoD-functionaL-diversitY (GODLY) - Benedetti et al. (in prep.)

This repository contains R scripts developed during my postdoc at ETH ZÃ¼rich, D-USYS, IBP, UP group.
The present R scripts were developed to produce the results a study in preparation about the global contemporary and future patterns of marine copepod functional diversity how it relates to the functioning of the biological carbon pump.

- Scripts labelled as 'RSCRIPTBATCH' are those that were run on a local cluster to perform those functions defined within the script in parallel using the 'parallel' R package (R Core Team, 2020) within a mclapply().
- Scripts that were given a number correspond to those R scripts were I formated and mined the main datasets involved. They usually contain organized sequences of code where data are being read, examined, reformatted, analyzed and plotted. The number given to a script mainly corresponds to a temporal marker, and not necessarily a direct sequence from one numbered script to another.
- "GODLY" just corresponds to name I gave to this project.
- The end of the scripts' names usually indicate their main purposes. A more detailed list of the scripts' goals and content is usually given in the beginning of the numbered scripts.
